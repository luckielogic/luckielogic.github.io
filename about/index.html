	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>Lucky's name is spelled with a -y, but that domain was taken. Thus, Luckie Logic was born. 
<p>Lucky is a six-year old rescue dog from California. He currently resides in Oregon with his two silly owners, one of which has a little too much time during the Covid-19 lockdown. Lucky is a black labrador mix, with a husky mind and coat, and a bit of (suspected) beagle thrown in as well.
<p>Lucky may look cute, but don't be fooled. He thinks he is very smart. This website is a collection of his everyday thoughts.
