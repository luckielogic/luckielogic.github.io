<p class="about">

Lucky is a six-year old good boy who originally came from the Californian desert. He currently resides in Oregon with his two silly humans. Lucky is a black labrador retriever mix, with a husky mind and coat, and a bit of (suspected) beagle thrown in as well.

Lucky's name is spelled with a -y, but the luckylogic domain name is taken. Thus, Luckie Logic was born.

Lucky may look cute and derpy, but don't be fooled. He thinks he is very smart. This website is a collection of his everyday thoughts and words of wisdom.
