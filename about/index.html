<font class="about">

Lucky is a six-year old rescue dog from the Californian desert. He currently resides in Oregon with his two silly owners, one of whom has too much time during the Covid-19 lockdown. Lucky is a black labrador mix, with a husky mind and coat, and a bit of (suspected) beagle thrown in as well.

Lucky's name is spelled with a -y, but the luckylogic domain name is taken. Thus, Luckie Logic was born.

Lucky may look cute and derpy, but don't be fooled. He thinks he is very smart. This website is a collection of his everyday thoughts.
